📌 Slide 1: Problem Statement

Title: Why Do We Need Image Denoising?

Points:

Poor-quality images are submitted during KYC or authentication (e.g., ID cards, forms).

Noisy images increase manual intervention, rejection rates, and fraud risk.

Visual noise can impact OCR, facial recognition, and document verification.

💡 Slide 2: Proposed Solution

Title: Streamlit-Based Image Denoising App

Points:

Built using Python, OpenCV, Streamlit.

Uses classical image processing to denoise images on the fly.

Helps automate image enhancement at low cost, low latency, and zero ML model training.

⚙️ Slide 3: How It Works

Title: App Workflow

Flowchart or Bullet:

1. User uploads noisy image (JPEG/PNG).


2. Image is denoised using OpenCV’s fastNlMeansDenoisingColored().


3. Denoised output shown with:

Execution time

PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)



4. Option to download clean image.
